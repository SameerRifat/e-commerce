### Server Actions (`src/lib/actions/size-management.ts`)
```typescript
// Key Features:
- Single optimized query for sizes with stats using window functions
- Comprehensive validation with schema and business rule checking
- Efficient pagination and search with proper SQL optimization
- Constraint checking for safe deletions
- Bulk reordering support for advanced sorting features
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Sizes table remains flat for optimal performance
-- Sort order provides flexible ordering without hierarchical complexity
-- Unique constraints on slug and sortOrder ensure data integrity
```

### Component Architecture
```

## 🚀 Key Innovations

### 1. Intuitive Sorting Mechanism
- **Quick Size Selection**: Predefined size buttons with automatic sort order assignment
- **Category-Based Organization**: Clothing sizes (1-8), Volume sizes (10-18), Other (20+)
- **Smart Auto-Generation**: Automatic slug generation and next available sort order
- **Visual Preview**: Real-time preview of size appearance in the system

### 2. Advanced Search & Filtering
- **Debounced Search**: 300ms debounce for optimal performance
- **URL-Based State**: Search terms persist in URL for shareability
- **Server-Side Processing**: All filtering and pagination handled server-side
- **Multi-Field Search**: Search across name, slug, and related data

### 3. Optimized Database Queries
- **Window Functions**: Single query for data + pagination count
- **Efficient Joins**: Left joins for variant counts without N+1 problems
- **Proper Indexing**: Optimized for common query patterns
- **Constraint Validation**: Batch validation in single database round-trip

### 4. Size Grouping Strategy
After evaluating database, API, and UI-level implementations, **UI-level grouping** was chosen as optimal:

**✅ Advantages:**
- Maintains simple, flat database structure
- Flexible grouping logic without schema changes
- Better performance (no additional queries)
- Easy to modify grouping rules
- Supports multiple grouping strategies simultaneously

**❌ Rejected Alternatives:**
- Database-level: Would complicate schema and queries
- API-level: Would reduce flexibility and increase complexity
